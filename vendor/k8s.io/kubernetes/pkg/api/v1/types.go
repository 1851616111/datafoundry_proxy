// The comments for the structs and fields can be used from go-resful to
// generate Swagger API documentation for its models. Please read this PR for more
// information on the implementation: https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/pull/215

// TODOs are ignored from the parser (e.g. TODO(andronat):... || TODO:...) if and only if
// they are on one line! For multiple line or blocks that you want to ignore use ---.
// Any context after a --- is ignored and not exported to the SwaggerAPI.
//
// The aforementioned methods can be generated by hack/update-generated-swagger-docs.sh

// Common string formats
// ---------------------
// Many fields in this API have formatting requirements. The commonly used
// formats are defined here.
//
// C_IDENTIFIER:  This is a string that conforms to the definition of an "identifier"
//     in the C language. This is captured by the following regex:
//         [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*
//     This defines the format, but not the length restriction, which should be
//     specified at the definition of any field of this type.
//
// DNS_LABEL:  This is a string, no more than 63 characters long, that conforms
//     to the definition of a "label" in RFCs 1035 and 1123. This is captured
//     by the following regex:
//         [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?
//
// DNS_SUBDOMAIN:  This is a string, no more than 253 characters long, that conforms
//      to the definition of a "subdomain" in RFCs 1035 and 1123. This is captured
//      by the following regex:
//         [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*
//     or more simply:
//         DNS_LABEL(\.DNS_LABEL)*
//
// IANA_SVC_NAME: This is a string, no more than 15 characters long, that
//      conforms to the definition of IANA service name in RFC 6335.
//      It must contains at least one letter [a-z] and it must contains only [a-z0-9-].
//      Hypens ('-') cannot be leading or trailing character of the string
//      and cannot be adjacent to other hyphens.

// ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
// users must create.
type ObjectMeta struct {
	// Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although
	// some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name
	// automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
	// definition.

	// If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
	// than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
	// The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
	// and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
	// unique on the server.
	//
	// If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
	// NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
	// ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client
	// should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

	// DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
	// field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
	// directly settable by a client. The resource will be deleted (no longer visible from
	// resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this
	// value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened
	// or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that
	// a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
	// signal to the containers in the pod. Once the resource is deleted in the API, the Kubelet
	// will send a hard termination signal to the container.
	// If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
